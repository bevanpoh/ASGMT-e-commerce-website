# Repository Info

This repository contains work done for my Backend Development Module Assignments at SP
The scope of the assignment consisted of developing a full-stack project for an e-commerce website along with a MySQL database for the website assets.

The website supports features for displaying and searching products stored in a database on a website and creating user profiles to leave reviews. Additionally, a dashboard interface for an admin to
modify product information through the website.

This repo contains all the code for hosting the servers locally.

- `backend_server` contains the javascript code for the Express APIs that request information from the database. The server is accessed through localhost:8081
- `frontend_server` contains the javascript code for the Express APIs that communicate through the backend server and display information through html pa1ges. The server is accessed through localhost:300
- `SQL_db` contains the mysql code to create the schema and populate the database
    - `Testing.docx` contains documentation of the backend API responses when requesting information from the database
